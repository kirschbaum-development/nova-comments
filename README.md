This package contains an inline commenting form for any resource to easily add comments. Think a simple version of Disqus for Nova!

## Requirements

This Nova resource tool requires Nova 4.0 or higher.  
For older version of Nova, use the tagged version [1.0.2](https://github.com/kirschbaum-development/nova-comments/releases/tag/1.0.2)

## Installation

You can install this package in a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require kirschbaum-development/nova-comments
```

Next, we need to run migrations. Auto-discovery of this package's service provider helps with that!

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

And lastly, any model that you want to have comments needs the `Commentable` trait added to it.

```php
use KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\Commentable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Commentable;
    
    // ...
}
```

If you would like to publish the config for this package, run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```
And choose the provider for this package: `KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\NovaCommentsServiceProvider`

This package requires that it has a commenter, which is simply a `User`. Nova Comments automatically defaults to the `App\Nova\User` resource, but can easily be changed in the publishable config file.

## Usage

There are two components that ship with this package, the `Commenter` and a `CommentsPanel`.

### Commenter

The first, and most useful, component is the `Commenter`. It is a resource tool that allows you to insert a commenting panel directly onto any Nova resource. This panel allows you to add a comment directly to a resource without needing to create one from the respective create view. The newly created comments show up below the commenting form with live updating.

Simply add the `KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\Commenter` resource tool in your Nova resource:

```php
namespace App\Nova;

use KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\Commenter;

class Post extends Resource
{
    // ...
    
    public function fields(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            // ...
            
            new Commenter(),

            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

Now you can comment from the detail view of any resource you've attached the `Commenter` to! Happy commenting!

### Comments Panel

As a convenience, a prebuilt comments panel has been created for you. All you need to do is simply add it to your resource and enjoy the pre-built goodness.

```php
namespace App\Nova;

use KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\Commenter;

class Post extends Resource
{
    // ...
    
    public function fields(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            // ...
            
            new CommentsPanel(),

            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

Of course you are completely free to create your own comments panel, but to get up and running quickly, we recommend using this panel.

### Sidebar Navigation

Occasionally you may want to hide comments from the sidebar. You can easily do this by setting the respective config value to false. Make sure to first publish the configs.

```php
'available-for-navigation' => false
```

### Pagination caveat

Due to an limitation in how Nova paginates results, there is currently no way to set the `perPage` value for the number of comments that will display at a time from a configuration value. Nova's default value is 5 per page. If you would like to set this to a different value, such as 25, we recommend you extend the `Commenter` and set this value with the follwing code:

```php
use KirschbaumDevelopment\NovaComments\Commenter as NovaCommenter;

class Commenter extends NovaCommenter
{
    /**
     * The number of resources to show per page via relationships.
     *
     * @var int
     */
    public static $perPageViaRelationship = 25;
}
```

Then use this class instead of the default `Commenter` class within your resources.

### Customizing the comment

By default, the `Comment` model will strip tags from the comment body. If you would like to modify this behavior, you can pass an callback to the `Comment::whenCreating` method. This callback will receive the comment model instance as a parameter.

```php
Comment::whenCreating(function (Comment $comment) {
    $comment->comment = strip_tags($comment->comment);
});
```

```php
